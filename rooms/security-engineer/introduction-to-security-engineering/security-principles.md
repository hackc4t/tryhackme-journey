- Introduction  
  Perfect security doesn‚Äôt exist, so the goal is to strengthen defenses by understanding adversaries and applying suitable controls.  
  This section will:
  
  ‚Ä£ Explain the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).  
  ‚Ä£ Present its opposite, DAD (Disclosure, Alteration, Destruction/Denial).  
  ‚Ä£ Introduce security models like Bell-LaPadula.  
  ‚Ä£ Explain principles such as Defence-in-Depth, Zero Trust, and Trust but Verify.  
  ‚Ä£ Introduce ISO/IEC 19249.  
  ‚Ä£ Clarify the differences between Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk.
  
- CIA  
  To evaluate security, we use the CIA triad:

  ‚Ä£ Confidentiality ensures only authorized people can access data.  
  ‚Ä£ Integrity ensures data cannot be altered and changes can be detected.  
  ‚Ä£ Availability ensures systems and services are accessible when needed.  

  For example, in online shopping, confidentiality protects credit card details, integrity prevents altered shipping addresses, and availability ensures the website or app remains accessible. Depending on context, one element may matter more, such as a university announcement where integrity is more important than confidentiality.

  Beyond CIA, two more key aspects are:
  
  ‚Ä£ Authenticity means verifying that data or documents are genuine and from the claimed source.  
  ‚Ä£ Nonrepudiation means ensuring the sender cannot deny their actions or authorship, which is essential for areas like banking or large transactions.

  Parkerian Hexad expands security to six elements: Availability, Utility, Integrity, Authenticity, Confidentiality, and Possession.

  The two remaining elements are:
  
  ‚Ä£ Utility, focuses on keeping information useful, for example when encrypted data becomes inaccessible without a decryption key.  
  ‚Ä£ Possession, refers to protecting data from unauthorized access, copying, or control, such as when an attacker steals a backup drive or encrypts data with ransomware.

- Zero Thrust Versus Trust but Verify
    

- Trust Versus Risk

  Security engineers must balance security with business needs, considering factors like operations, cost, implementation, and usability. While complete isolation is the most secure state, it prevents achieving business goals. Therefore, a security engineer‚Äôs decisions must align security measures with organizational objectives.

- Conclusion

  A security engineer is responsible for an organization‚Äôs cybersecurity, ensuring systems and infrastructure are built securely, maintaining and improving the security posture over time, and supporting other teams to achieve a collectively secure environment.
