### üìò Content
- Introduction  
Learning objectives: understanding why security engineers are needed, what qualifications they require, what their typical day looks like, and exploring additional roles and responsibilities they might have.

- What is a Security Engineer?  
  Organizations need security to protect their digital assets from cyber attacks, data loss, and ransomware, ensuring their operations and goals continue without disruption.  

  Security engineers are responsible for securing an organization‚Äôs digital assets, minimizing cybersecurity risks, developing secure systems and network solutions, conducting tests to identify weaknesses, and coordinating security protocols across teams.  

  The role varies by organization but generally requires 0‚Äì2 years of IT, network, or security experience, along with basic knowledge of networks, operating systems, programming, and security concepts like Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).

- Core Responsibilities of a Security Engineer  
  A security engineer is expected to handle key areas that support an organization‚Äôs overall security posture.  

  They manage asset inventory, maintaining an updated list of all digital assets with details like type, IP, network position, and access permissions.  

  They create and enforce security policies based on security principles, ensure proper implementation, and handle exceptions by minimizing risks.  

  They promote a secure-by-design approach by implementing secure network architecture, hardening systems, and following the Secure Software Development Lifecycle.

  They oversee security assessment and assurance, scheduling regular audits, assessments, and red/purple team exercises, coordinating with external parties, and helping implement findings to continuously strengthen security.

- Continuous Improvment  
  A security engineer‚Äôs work is an ongoing process focused on continuous improvement.  

  They ensure awareness by conducting regular training sessions to prevent social engineering attacks and promote secure practices across teams.  

  They manage risks by identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks, advising management on decisions to accept or reduce risks while maintaining operational stability.  

  They handle change management by assessing new systems or updates, ensuring they meet security requirements through testing, risk assessments, and compliance with policies.  

  They oversee vulnerability management, monitoring and patching vulnerabilities based on severity to keep systems secure.  

  Finally, they ensure compliance and audits, working with auditors to maintain adherence to standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO27001, and NIST-800-53, while preserving the organization‚Äôs security certifications.  

- Additional Roles and Responsibilities  
  A security engineer‚Äôs role can extend to additional responsibilities depending on the organization.  

  They may handle security tooling, configuring and fine-tuning systems like SIEMs, Firewalls, WAFs, and EDRs, and advising on tool procurement based on organizational needs and technical assessments.  

  They might conduct tabletop exercises to test the organization‚Äôs security readiness, guiding team members through response procedures for simulated attack scenarios.  

  They also assist in disaster recovery and crisis management, helping plan for incidents, ensuring business continuity, and supporting compliance with relevant frameworks and internal policies.  

- Walking in Their Shoes

  Security engineers must balance security with business needs, considering factors like operations, cost, implementation, and usability. While complete isolation is the most secure state, it prevents achieving business goals. Therefore, a security engineer‚Äôs decisions must align security measures with organizational objectives.

- Conclusion

  A security engineer is responsible for an organization‚Äôs cybersecurity, ensuring systems and infrastructure are built securely, maintaining and improving the security posture over time, and supporting other teams to achieve a collectively secure environment.
